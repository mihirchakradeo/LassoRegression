It is divided into two parts:

### Lasso Regression on synthetic data
Here, I generated some synthetic data from a Normal Distribution and applied Lasso Regression to it
### Kaggle Goodness of Wine Review data challenge
The task was to predict the points the wine should get based on its review text alone.
